# Hearts & Hearths
Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/modpack/heartsandhearths

Hearts & Hearths is a modpack that my girlfriend and I put together for fun and, we wanted to feature some of the best additions to minecraft with mods ranging from calm and sweet mods such as "Farmer's Delight" and the "Let's Do" series of mods to more RPG based mods such as "Simply Swords," "Bountiful," and "Zenith."

Hearts & Hearths is our attempt at putting some of the widest variation of Minecraft mods together and having a fun playthrough. There is no serious story to play through; instead, you can play through a more polished modded Minecraft.

This modpack is still a work in progress and will recieve updates whenever necessary or if we find a better path to take this.

All mods in this modpack are to be credited to only the mod developers, thank you for making this conglomeration possible :)

The modpack includes decorative mods, structure and terrain generation mods, combat mods, magic mods, farming mods, and many more to suit your playthrough (It's more fun with friends!)



## **The pack is separated by client and server versions:**
- Client Versions: x.x-xC
